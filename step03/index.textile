You'll need these parts to assemble your Y-Plates:

|\3{color:#fff;background: #383838}. **Core Components Kit** |
| **SKU** | **Name** | **Quantity** |
| 30525-01 | Gantry Side Plate (Y-Plate) | 2 |
| 25197-04 | Smooth Idler Wheel Kit | 4 |
| 25203-04 | Dual Bearing V-Wheel Kit | 8 |
| 25286-22 | Button Head Cap Screw M5 x 35mm | 4 |
| 25286-21 | Button Head Cap Screw M5 x 25mm | 8 |
| 30265-04 | Nylon Insert Lock Nut M5 | 8 |

| 25287-08 | Flat Washer M5 | 8 |
| 25312-23 | Aluminum Spacer 5.1mm ID 9.5mm OD 9.5mm LG | 4 |

h3. 1) Smooth Idlers

You'll mount two smooth idlers to each Y-Plate. These are the mounting holes:

To mount a smooth idler to your Y-Plate slide it onto a 35mm screw followed by an aluminum spacer. Remember that the smooth idler is an asymmetrical part. **Just as in the X-Carriage assembly, make sure the side of the Smooth Idler with the protruding bearing is installed next to the aluminum spacer.** Insert the screw through the Y-Plate and fasten it with a hex nut on the other side. Tighten the nut with moderate force.

h3. 2) V-Wheels

Each Y-Plate has four holes for V-Wheels. Just like the X Carriage there are two sizes of holes that accept V-Wheels; the smaller holes are for V-Wheels with nylock nuts and the larger holes are designed to accept V-Wheels with eccentric nuts.

h4. V- Wheels with Nylock Nuts

Start by installing the top two V-Wheels. Put a V-Wheel on a 25mm button head cap screw followed by a washer. Tighten a nylock nut on the other side of the plate:
