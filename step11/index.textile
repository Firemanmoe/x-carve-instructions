You'll need these parts to assemble the X Carriage:

|\3{color:#fff;background: #383838}. **Core Components Kit** |
| **SKU** | **Name** | **Quantity** |
| 30545-01 | X Carriage Extrusion | 1 |
| 25197-04 | Smooth Idler Wheel Kit | 2 |
| 25203-04 | Dual Bearing V-Wheel Kit | 8 |
| 30552-01 | Flat Head Socket Cap Screw M5 x 35mm | 2 |
| 25286-21 | Button Head Cap Screw M5 x 25mm | 8 |
| 30265-04 | Nylon Insert Lock Nut M5 | 6 |
| 30158-01 | Eccentric Nut M5 | 4 |
| 25287-08 | Flat Washer M5 | 8 |
| 25312-23 | Aluminum Spacer 5.1mm ID 9.5mm OD 9.5mm LG | 2|

h3. 1. Smooth Idlers

The first thing you’ll do is attach the smooth idlers. Insert one of the flat head screws like this:

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/473/original/0009.jpg?1423589578!

Next you’ll put a spacer onto the screw followed by the smooth idler and a nylock hex nut. Tighten the hex nut with moderate force.

</div>

p=. _Note: make sure the side of the Smooth Idler with the protruding bearing is installed next to the aluminum spacer.  If not, the plastic portion of the Smooth Idler may get in the way of the screws used to mount your stepper motor._

Repeat this process with the other smooth idler.

h3. 2. V-Wheels

Next you’ll be attaching the V-Wheels. There will be eight V-Wheels on the X Carriage, four of them will be attached with nylock nuts and the other four will be attached with eccentric nuts. The holes for the eccentric nuts are larger.

h4. V-Wheels with Nylock Nuts

Start by attaching one of the top four V-Wheels with nylock nuts. You’ll insert a 25mm button head cap screw into this hole on the X Carriage. 

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/642/original/0028.jpg?1424455895!

Next slide a washer over the screw, followed by a V-Wheel and a nylock hex nut. Tighten the nut with moderate force.

Repeat that three times and your X Carriage will look like this:

h4. V-Wheels with Eccentric Nuts

Next you’ll attach the bottom V-Wheels with eccentric nuts. These nuts have a "shoulder" on them which is designed to be seated in various holes on your X-Carve.

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/488/span4/Eccentric%20Nut.jpg?1423759789!

You'll need to adjust them later so put a V-Wheel and then a washer onto a screw and insert it into the X Carriage from the inside. 

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/483/original/0050.jpg?1423679351!

Thread the eccentric nut onto the screw making sure the “shoulder” is facing the X Carriage. Be sure to seat the shoulder in the hole on the X Carriage and tighten the screw with moderate force.

p=. !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/652/original/0050.jpg?1424456639! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/654/original/0052.jpg?1424456640! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/656/original/0054.jpg?1424456642! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/657/original/0063.jpg?1424456688!

Repeat this process for the remaining three V-Wheels. When you're done your X Carriage should look like this:

h3. 3. Motor Mounting 

h4. Mounting Your NEMA 17 Stepper Motor

h5. (If you purchased NEMA 23s skip this step)

|\3{color:#fff;background: #cc3440}. **NEMA 17 Stepper Motor Kit** |
| **SKU** | **Name** | **Quantity** |
| 25253-01 | Stepper Motor NEMA 17 62 oz-in | 1 |
| 26054-01 | Aluminum GT2 Pulley 20T 5mm | 1 |
| 25285-32 | Socket Head Cap Screw M3 x 10mm | 3 |
| 25287-10 | Flat Washer M3 | 3 |

"NEMA 17 Motor Mounting Video":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrW56e4f3Bk

Start this step by putting a pulley on your NEMA 17 stepper motor. You will use two set screws to hold it in place. Slide it on so the edge is flush with the end of the motor shaft and tighten the screws just enough to hold it in place.

!(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/662/original/1290.jpg?1424459090! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/663/original/1291.jpg?1424459091! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/664/original/1292.jpg?1424459092! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/665/original/1294.jpg?1424459116!

Your NEMA 17 motor has tapped holes to accept screws, take a moment to locate them. You'll use three of the four on the motor. Orient the motor as shown with the wires pointing up and to the right:

!(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/678/original/1300.jpg?1424463225! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/672/original/1297.jpg?1424463007! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/673/original/1298.jpg?1424463010! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/674/original/1303.jpg?1424463013!

Put a washer on each screw and insert them  from the opposite side of the X Carriage using the access holes. You may find it easier to start the screws by inserting them from the side of the carriage and then tightening them through the access holes. Tighten these screws with moderate force.

h4. Mounting Your NEMA 23 Stepper Motor

h5. (If you purchased NEMA 17s skip this step)

|\3{color:#fff;background: #cc3440}. **NEMA 23 Stepper Motor Kit** |

| 25285-41 | Socket Head Cap Screw M5 x 10mm | 4 |

"NEMA 23 Motor Mounting Video":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-rUEsHl78

Start this step by putting a pulley on your NEMA 23 stepper motor. You will use two set screws to hold it in place. Slide it on so the edge is flush with the end of the motor shaft and tighten the screws just enough to hold it in place.

!(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/667/original/0139.jpg?1424462093! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/668/original/0141.jpg?1424462104! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/669/original/0143.jpg?1424462115! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/670/original/0148.jpg?1424462125! 


The NEMA 23 mounting holes on the X Carriage are tapped. Simply insert the screws through the motor housing and screw them into the X Carriage. Get all of the screws finger tight and then tighten them in an x-pattern with moderate force . Be sure to orient the wires of your stepper motor towards the bottom of the X Carriage.

h3{clear:both}. 4. Positioning of Eccentric Nuts

The eccentric nuts on your X-Carve are a slick little example of good engineering. By rotating the nut you can change the position of the screw it captures. You'll use these to adjust the position of V-Wheels all over the machine. Before going any further take a minute to position the eccentric nuts on the X Carriage to the “open” position. In this position the screw that is held by the nut is down and as far away from the top V-wheels as possible. When we refer to an eccentric nut being in the open position it will always be as far away from a static V-Wheel as possible. Here’s a photo that illustrates this concept:

| 30331-09 | Drag Chain Male End Link | 1 |
| 30554-01 | Flat Head Socket Cap Screw M4 x 10mm | 2 |

There are two ends to each length of drag chain for your X-Carve. One of the ends is male and one is female.

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/613/original/0887.jpg?1424383861!

Detach one of the male ends with a flat blade screw driver.

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/614/original/0897.jpg?1424383893!

Mount it on the X Carriage by inserting the screws through the holes in the chain and screwing them into the tapped holes on the carriage.

| 30555-02 | Split Lock Washer M2 | 2 |

Put the lock washers onto the screws and insert them through the switch and into the holes on the X Carriage (they're on the right side if you're looking at the motor). Use a pair of pliers and a screwdriver to snug these down just passed finger tight.
