**For those of you using a Windows PC** to control your newly assembled X-Carve, head on over to the Arduino downloads page and get the drivers to allow communication between your PC and Arduino.  Make sure you **STOP after step _4 | Install the drivers_**, or else the pre-loaded Grbl firmware required to communicate with your machine will be wiped from the Arduino.

**For those of you using a Mac** to control your X-Carve, you don't have any drivers to install.
